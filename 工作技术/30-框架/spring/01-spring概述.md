## 1. 设计理念

- Provide choice at every level. Spring lets you defer design decisions as late as possible. For example, you can switch persistence providers through configuration without changing your code. The same is true for many other infrastructure concerns and integration with third-party APIs.

提供每个级别的选择。Spring允许您尽可能推迟设计决策。例如，您可以通过配置提供经常变换的程序，而无需更改代码。许多其他基础设施问题以及与第三方API的集成也是如此。

- Accommodate diverse perspectives. Spring embraces flexibility and is not opinionated about how things should be done. It supports a wide range of application needs with different perspectives.

多样化。Spring具有灵活性，并且对应该如何操作并不固执己见。它以不同的视角支持广泛的应用需求。

- Maintain strong backward compatibility. Spring’s evolution has been carefully managed to force few breaking changes between versions. Spring supports a carefully chosen range of JDK versions and third-party libraries to facilitate maintenance of applications and libraries that depend on Spring.

保持强大的向后兼容性。Spring的发展经过精心管理，在版本之间几乎没有突破性的变化。Spring支持一系列精心挑选的JDK版本和第三方库，以便于维护依赖Spring的应用程序和库。

- Care about API design. The Spring team puts a lot of thought and time into making APIs that are intuitive and that hold up across many versions and many years.

关心API设计。Spring团队投入了大量的精力和时间来制作直观的API，这些API可以跨越多个版本和多年。

- Set high standards for code quality. The Spring Framework puts a strong emphasis on meaningful, current, and accurate javadoc. It is one of very few projects that can claim clean code structure with no circular dependencies between packages.

为代码质量设定高标准。Spring框架非常强调有意义、最新和准确的javadoc。这是极少数几个可以声称代码结构干净、包之间没有循环依赖关系的项目之一。
